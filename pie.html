                I have been through a lot in life, but that hasn't stopped me 
                from trying to succeed. Every time I fall,
                I always try to find a way to get back up again.<br>
                I am a survivor and I refuse to quit, 
                no matter what challenges come my way. Though I have gotten hurt too many times before,<br>
                I have become a better person in the end. I'm a transparent person; I prefer to tell 
                someone when they are doing wrong in terms of fixing the problems.<br>
                I'm helpful, supportive and motivates people.
